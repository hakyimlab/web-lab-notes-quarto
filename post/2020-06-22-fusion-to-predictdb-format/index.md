If you want to use the MetaXcan suite of tools, you will need to format your prediction weights in sqlite format.

## how to convert fusion weights to predictdb format (sqlite)
Find a sample script that formats FUSION weights to predictdb format [here](https://hakyimlab.github.io/psychencode/generate_weights.html)

## how to compute covariances between SNPs to use summary PrediXcan
If you want to use the summary version of PrediXcan, you will also need the covariances between SNPs
Fine a sample script [here](https://hakyimlab.github.io/psychencode/calculate_covariances.html)
