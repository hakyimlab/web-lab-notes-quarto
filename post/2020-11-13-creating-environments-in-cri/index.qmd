1)  Create the new environment in the lab share

```
conda create --prefix /gpfs/data/im-lab/nas40t2/bin/envs/env_name 
```

2)  Activate the new environment

```
conda activate env_name
```

3)  Install whatever you want in your new environment. Also because the environment is in the labshare, anyone can use it just by calling

```
conda install <software>
conda activate /gpfs/data/im-lab/nas40t2/bin/envs/env_name
```
