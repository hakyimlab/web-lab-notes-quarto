#Guardian-bslmm-model - `/gpfs/data/im-lab/nas40t2/festus/metabolomics/paper-data/guardian-irasfs-bslmm.db`

#Hybrid best model (cor > 0.1) - `/gpfs/data/im-lab/nas40t2/festus/metabolomics/paper-data/hybrid-model-best-cor0.1.db`

#Hybrid all models (guardian, omicspred, metsim) - `/gpfs/data/im-lab/nas40t2/festus/metabolomics/paper-data/hybrid-model-all-metabolon.db`

#Metaboxcan reports (v1) using the Hybrid-models - `/Users/user/Box/imlab-data/Metaboxcan/old-summaries` - the metaboxcan_best contains the results from the best models above and pvalue corrected while the metaboxcan_all contains the results from all of the hybrid models combined without filtering. The metsim model used in the hybrid was the one generated using PRScs from the summary stats.

#Metaboxcan reports (v2) using the Metsim lasso models - `/Users/user/Box/imlab-data/Metaboxcan/summaries` - the metaboxcan_best and metaboxcan_all sheet contain same results only one difference is best contains pvalues corrected by bacon.
